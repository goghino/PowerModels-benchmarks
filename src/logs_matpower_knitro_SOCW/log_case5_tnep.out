EXIT: Convergence to an infeasible point. Problem appears to be locally
      infeasible. If problem is believed to be feasible, try multistart 
      to search for feasible points, or decrease infeastol.

HINT: Knitro spent 0.000845 seconds checking model convexity.
      To skip the automatic convexity checker for QPs and QCQPs,
      explicity set the user option convex=0 or convex=1.
