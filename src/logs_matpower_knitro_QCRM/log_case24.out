EXIT: Locally optimal solution found.

HINT: Cone constraints were identified, but option bar_conic_enable=0.
      Setting bar_conic_enable=1 may improve performance.

HINT: Knitro spent 0.001023 seconds checking model convexity.
      To skip the automatic convexity checker for QPs and QCQPs,
      explicity set the user option convex=0 or convex=1.
