[warn | PowerModels]: the dc line model is not meant to be used bi-directionally when loss1 > 0, be careful interpreting the results as the dc line losses can now be negative. change loss1 to 0 to avoid this warning
[warn | PowerModels]: the to bus voltage setpoint on dc line 1 does not match the value at bus 5
